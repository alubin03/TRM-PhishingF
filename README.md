# Phishing Analysis Fundamentals

Spam and Phishing are common social engineering attacks. In social engineering, phishing attack vectors can be a phone call, a text message, or an email. In this lab I started out by reviewing the components of an email address and how and the process of an email being delivered. Reviewed a bit of the OSI model to gain an understanding for SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol),POP3 (Post Office Protocol), and IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol).  You see I was always a bit confused about the difference between POP3 AND IMAP.
If your emails setting are on POP3 emails are downloaded and can only be stored on a single device. But with IMAP emails are stored on the server and can be synced to multiple devices. So if your wondering why your not getting emails on that fancy new laptop...üëÄ

After that I dug into the email header and body and learned about something called "raw" email details. I was introduced to certain things that I should look for when analyzing potentially malicious emails.
Overall, the TryHackMe Phishing Analysis Fundamentals lab was an incredibly valuable experience that taught me a lot about how to identify phishing attacks.

Until next time‚úåüèΩ
